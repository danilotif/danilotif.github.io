Wirth's Law observes that software gets slower faster than hardware gets faster.

No single decision caused this - it's the pattern of always adding, never removing.",

The assumption that \"many eyes\" equals \"thoroughly reviewed\" is often wrong.",

          "explanation": "The Zeigarnik Effect: uncompleted tasks create mental tension and are remembered better than completed ones. Your brain keeps the task \"open\" like an unsaved document, using cognitive resources to prevent forgetting. Once completed, the tension releases and the task leaves working memory. This is why half-done tasks are so mentally draining.",
          "takeaway": "Either complete tasks or write them down to \"close the loop\" mentally. A task list externalizes the remembering, freeing mental resources."

          "explanation": "The Two-Minute Rule states: if a task takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. The overhead of tracking, remembering, and context-switching back to small tasks exceeds the time to just complete them. Letting two-minute tasks accumulate creates an anxiety-inducing backlog that feels much larger than it actually is.",
          "takeaway": "Handle quick tasks immediately. The mental overhead of postponing is often greater than just doing it. This keeps your inbox and task list from overwhelming you."

Both work by creating artificial constraints that prevent perfectionism, procrastination, and scope creep. The timer makes the work feel finite and manageable.",

Urgency wins by default unless you deliberately prioritize importance.",

This applies to time management, business, software, and countless other domains.",

She was promoted based on her current performance, not her aptitude for the new role.",

Analysis paralysis kicks in when you have so many options that deciding becomes harder than not deciding.",

Wirth's Law observes that software gets slower faster than hardware gets faster. Each individual feature might have been justified, but the cumulative effect is an unmaintainable, slow, confusing product. No single decision caused this - it's the pattern of always adding, never removing.",

Prevention methods include: having leaders speak last, assigning a \"devil's advocate\" role, anonymous feedback, and actively soliciting dissent.",

She was promoted based on her current performance, not her aptitude for the new role.",

The hidden danger: important complex decisions get rubber-stamped while trivial ones consume all the critical thinking energy.",

Beyond this, we can't keep track of everyone's relationships, reputations, and histories. The informal trust-based culture that worked at 50 people breaks down at 200. You can't know everyone anymore - you need formal processes, documented norms, and explicit structures.",

After a few iterations, the junior can do it in 3 hours alone. After more practice, 2 hours. You've multiplied yourself.",
          "takeaway": "Invest in delegation even when it's slower initially. Ask: \"Will this task come up again?\" If yes, the teaching time is an investment, not a cost."

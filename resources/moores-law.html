        <h1>Understanding Moore's Law</h1>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            "The number of transistors on a computer chip doubles approximately every two years, though the cost of computers is halved over the same period."
            <br><strong>— Gordon Moore, 1965</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>What Moore's Law Means</h2>
        <p>Moore's Law is a prediction that the number of transistors on a computer chip doubles approximately every two years, while the cost of computers is halved over the same period. Formulated by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965, this observation has served as both a prediction and a roadmap for the semiconductor industry for over five decades, driving unprecedented technological advancement.</p>
        
        <p>More broadly, Moore's Law represents the exponential improvement in computing power over time. It's not a law of physics but rather an empirical observation that became a self-fulfilling prophecy, as the entire tech industry organized itself around meeting Moore's predictions through continuous innovation and investment.</p>

        <h2>The Original Observation</h2>
        
        <div class="example">
            <strong>1965 Prediction:</strong> Moore noted that the number of components (transistors) that could be placed on a computer chip had doubled every year since the invention of the integrated circuit in 1959, and predicted this trend would continue.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>1975 Revision:</strong> Moore revised his prediction to doubling every two years, which became the widely accepted version of Moore's Law.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Exponential Growth:</strong> From thousands of transistors in early microprocessors to billions in modern processors—a million-fold increase following Moore's exponential curve.
        </div>

        <h2>Real-World Impact</h2>
        
        <div class="stats">
            1971 Intel 4004: 2,300 transistors
            <br>2020 Apple M1: 16 billion transistors
            <br>Nearly 7 million times more transistors in 50 years
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Personal Computing:</strong> Room-sized computers from the 1960s became desktop PCs in the 1980s, laptops in the 1990s, and smartphones that fit in our pockets by the 2000s.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Internet Revolution:</strong> Moore's Law enabled the processing power necessary for the World Wide Web, social media, streaming video, and cloud computing.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Scientific Advancement:</strong> Exponentially increasing computational power enabled weather prediction, genome sequencing, artificial intelligence, and complex simulations.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Economic Transformation:</strong> Entire industries emerged based on the assumption that computing would become dramatically more powerful and affordable over time.
        </div>

        <h2>Beyond Transistor Count</h2>
        <p>Moore's Law spawned related observations about exponential improvement in technology:</p>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>Moore's Law represents more than a prediction about transistors—it embodies the power of exponential technological improvement and the importance of long-term vision in driving innovation. For over 50 years, it served as both prediction and goal, organizing an entire industry around the pursuit of exponential improvement.</p>
        
        <p>While the original formulation may be reaching its limits due to physical constraints, the spirit of Moore's Law continues in new forms: the relentless pursuit of better performance, lower costs, and enabling new capabilities through technological innovation. Whether through new materials, architectures, or entirely different computing paradigms, the quest for exponential improvement continues to drive technological progress and transform our world.</p>

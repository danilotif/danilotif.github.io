        <h1>Putt's Law</h1>

        <div class="highlight">
            "Technology is dominated by two types of people: those who understand what they do not manage, and those who manage what they do not understand."
            <br><strong>— Archibald Putt (pseudonym)</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>What Putt's Law Means</h2>
        <p>Putt's Law, articulated in the satirical book "Putt's Law and the Successful Technocrat," describes a fundamental split in technology organizations. Technical experts understand the work but lack decision-making authority, while managers have authority over work they don't understand. The result is a persistent gap between those who know and those who decide.</p>

        <p>The law suggests this isn't accidental but structural. The skills that create technical competence differ from the skills that lead to management positions. Technical depth often correlates with personality traits (introversion, detail-orientation, skepticism) that conflict with traits favored for advancement (charisma, optimism, political savvy).</p>

        <h2>How It Develops</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Career Divergence:</strong> Early in careers, technical and management paths are similar. Over time, managers become increasingly removed from technical work while engineers become increasingly specialized. Each knows progressively less about the other's domain.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Selection Effects:</strong> Those most passionate about technology often prefer doing it over managing others doing it. Those who pursue management may be less technically inclined from the start, or may lose technical skills through disuse.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Speed of Change:</strong> Technology evolves faster than managerial knowledge can keep pace. A manager who was technical five years ago now oversees technologies that didn't exist when they coded regularly.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Abstraction Layers:</strong> As managers rise, they receive increasingly abstracted information. Technical complexity is summarized into dashboards and status reports that obscure ground truth.
        </div>

        <h2>Consequences</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Unrealistic Commitments:</strong> Managers promise deliverables without understanding technical complexity. Engineers are told to "just make it work" without resources or time to do so properly.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Technology Choices:</strong> Decisions about platforms, languages, and architectures are made based on vendor relationships, trend-following, or resume-building rather than technical fit.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Technical Debt:</strong> Shortcuts that create long-term problems are invisible to managers focused on short-term deliverables. By the time consequences emerge, decision-makers have moved on.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Communication Failures:</strong> Engineers struggle to explain problems in terms managers understand. Managers struggle to set priorities in terms engineers find meaningful. Both sides become frustrated.
        </div>

        <h2>The Competence Gap in Action</h2>
        <p>Putt identified several patterns that emerge from this division:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>The First Corollary:</strong> Every technical hierarchy eventually develops a managerial override that makes technically sound decisions impossible</li>
            <li><strong>Competence Avoidance:</strong> Truly competent technologists are threatening to insecure managers and may be sidelined or undermined</li>
            <li><strong>Metric Manipulation:</strong> What gets measured gets gamed; managers optimize for visible metrics while technical reality deteriorates</li>
            <li><strong>Blame Displacement:</strong> When projects fail, those who made decisions blame those who implemented them</li>
            <li><strong>Success Attribution:</strong> When projects succeed, managers claim credit while engineers remain invisible</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Navigating Putt's Law</h2>

        <div class="tips">
            <h3>For Technical Professionals:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Learn to Translate:</strong> Develop ability to explain technical realities in business terms</li>
                <li><strong>Document Decisions:</strong> Create paper trails showing who decided what based on what information</li>
                <li><strong>Build Alliances:</strong> Find managers who value technical input and cultivate those relationships</li>
                <li><strong>Manage Up:</strong> Proactively educate managers about technical constraints before decisions are made</li>
                <li><strong>Choose Wisely:</strong> When possible, work for organizations or managers who respect technical expertise</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>For Managers:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stay Humble:</strong> Acknowledge your knowledge limits rather than pretending competence you lack</li>
                <li><strong>Trust Experts:</strong> When technical staff warn of problems, take warnings seriously</li>
                <li><strong>Stay Connected:</strong> Maintain enough technical understanding to ask good questions</li>
                <li><strong>Create Safe Channels:</strong> Make it safe for technical staff to deliver bad news</li>
                <li><strong>Share Credit:</strong> Acknowledge technical contributions to success</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Organizational Countermeasures</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Technical Leadership Tracks:</strong> Create advancement paths that don't require abandoning technical work</li>
            <li><strong>Rotation Programs:</strong> Keep managers connected to technical reality through periodic hands-on work</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Advisory Boards:</strong> Give technical experts formal input into major decisions</li>
            <li><strong>Decision Documentation:</strong> Record the reasoning behind technical decisions, including dissenting views</li>
            <li><strong>Retrospectives:</strong> Honestly assess what worked and didn't, tracing outcomes to decisions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>Putt's Law describes a genuine tension in technology organizations: expertise and authority naturally diverge. The people who best understand technical work rarely control it, while those who control it rarely understand it.</p>

        <p>This isn't a problem with easy solutions. Organizations need both technical excellence and managerial coordination. The goal isn't eliminating the divide but bridging it—creating structures and cultures where technical knowledge genuinely influences decisions, where managers respect their knowledge limits, and where communication flows effectively across the competence gap.</p>

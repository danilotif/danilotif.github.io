        <h1>Putt's Corollary</h1>

        <div class="highlight">
            "Every technical hierarchy, in time, develops a competence inversion: those who can't do the work end up directing those who can."
            <br><strong>— Archibald Putt, Putt's Law and the Successful Technocrat</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>What Putt's Corollary Means</h2>
        <p>Putt's Corollary extends Putt's Law (technology is dominated by two types of people: those who understand what they do not manage, and those who manage what they do not understand) to describe how technical organizations naturally evolve toward a state where decision-making authority rests with people who don't understand the technical work being done.</p>

        <p>This happens because technical competence and managerial competence are different things, and organizations systematically promote based on one while requiring the other. The result is engineers being managed by people who couldn't write code, scientists being directed by people who don't understand research, and technical decisions being made by those least qualified to make them.</p>

        <h2>How the Inversion Happens</h2>

        <h3>The Technical Ladder Problem</h3>
        <p>Highly competent technical people often stay in technical roles because that's what they're good at and enjoy. Meanwhile, those who are less technically stellar but more politically savvy or management-inclined climb the hierarchy. Over time, the people at the top understand the technology least.</p>

        <h3>The Knowledge Gap</h3>
        <p>Technology changes rapidly. Managers who once had technical skills see those skills atrophy while they attend meetings. After a few years, they're making decisions about technologies they no longer understand—and sometimes never understood in the first place.</p>

        <h3>The Selection Effect</h3>
        <p>Organizations often select managers based on tenure, charisma, or political skill rather than technical competence. This accelerates the competence inversion by actively choosing less technical people for positions of authority.</p>

        <div class="stats">
            Common patterns:<br>
            Technical decisions increasingly require management approval<br>
            Management approval is given by those who can't evaluate the technical merit<br>
            Technical staff must "translate" their work for non-technical decision-makers<br>
            Important technical decisions get made based on PowerPoint presentations
        </div>

        <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>The IT Department:</strong> Technical architecture decisions are made by a CIO who hasn't coded in 20 years, based on vendor presentations and management consultants, while the engineers who actually understand the systems have little input.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>The Pharma Company:</strong> Research direction is set by executives with MBAs, not PhDs. Scientists must convince non-scientists that their research is worth funding, often based on oversimplified explanations and optimistic timelines.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>The Defense Contractor:</strong> Weapons systems requirements are set by generals who don't understand the technology and program managers who've never engineered anything. Engineers must build to specifications that sometimes violate physics.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>The Hospital System:</strong> Healthcare IT decisions are made by administrators who don't understand clinical workflows. The resulting systems frustrate the clinicians who must use them, because they were designed to satisfy people who'll never use them.
        </div>

        <h2>Symptoms of Competence Inversion</h2>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Signs your organization has this problem:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Technical staff spend more time justifying decisions than making them</li>
                <li>Management overrides technical recommendations regularly</li>
                <li>Important technical decisions are made in meetings technical staff don't attend</li>
                <li>Technical debt accumulates because non-technical management won't fund fixes</li>
                <li>"The business" and "the technical side" are treated as opposing factions</li>
                <li>Simple technical explanations are dismissed; complex ones are accepted without understanding</li>
                <li>Promotions go to those who explain well, not those who build well</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

        <h3>Bad Technical Decisions</h3>
        <p>When people who don't understand technology make technology decisions, those decisions tend to be wrong. Wrong architecture choices, wrong vendor selections, wrong project priorities—all made by people confident in their authority but lacking in relevant knowledge.</p>

        <h3>Frustrated Technical Staff</h3>
        <p>Nothing demoralizes technical people faster than watching bad decisions being made by people who don't understand the consequences. The best technical talent often leaves for organizations where their expertise is respected.</p>

        <h3>Innovation Stifles</h3>
        <p>Innovation requires risk-taking and experimentation. When technical proposals must be approved by non-technical management, only proposals that can be explained simply and promised safely will survive. This filters out precisely the work most likely to create breakthroughs.</p>

        <h2>Addressing the Inversion</h2>

        <div class="tips">
            <strong>Organizational strategies:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technical leadership tracks:</strong> Create paths for technical authority separate from management</li>
                <li><strong>Technical veto power:</strong> Let technical experts block decisions in their domain</li>
                <li><strong>Require technical competence:</strong> Demand technical credentials for technical leadership roles</li>
                <li><strong>Flatten technical decisions:</strong> Push decision-making to the people with knowledge</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous technical education:</strong> Keep management technically current</li>
                <li><strong>Technical rotation:</strong> Rotate managers back into technical roles periodically</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>For Technical Individuals</h3>
        <p>If you're technically competent and want to retain influence: learn to communicate with non-technical stakeholders without condescension, build political capital alongside technical skills, and consider whether management roles (with their power to prevent bad decisions) might be worth pursuing despite their drawbacks.</p>

        <h3>For Organizations</h3>
        <p>Create structures where technical expertise has formal authority. Establish technical review boards with real power. Require technical due diligence on decisions affecting technical systems. Make it culturally unacceptable to override technical recommendations without technical justification.</p>

        <h2>The Technocrat's Dilemma</h2>

        <p>Putt observed that successful technical people face a choice: stay technical and lose organizational influence, or pursue management and lose technical competence. There's rarely a path that preserves both. Organizations that solve this dilemma—creating roles that maintain both technical excellence and organizational authority—have a significant competitive advantage.</p>

        <h2>Exceptions and Hope</h2>

        <p>Some organizations successfully resist competence inversion. They share certain characteristics: founders who stayed technical, cultures that explicitly value technical expertise, structures that give technical staff real authority, and promotion criteria that include technical depth even for management roles. It's possible—just not the default.</p>

        <p>Putt's Corollary describes a natural tendency, not an inevitable fate. By understanding how competence inversion develops, organizations can build structures and cultures that resist it. The alternative is technical decisions made by the technically illiterate—and the predictable failures that follow.</p>

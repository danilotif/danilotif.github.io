        <h1>Hick's Law</h1>

        <div class="highlight">
            "The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices"
            <br><strong>— William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman, 1952</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>What Hick's Law Means</h2>
        <p>Hick's Law (also known as the Hick-Hyman Law) states that the time required to make a decision increases logarithmically with the number of available choices. In simpler terms: more options means slower decisions, but the relationship isn't linear—doubling the options doesn't double the decision time.</p>

        <p>The mathematical formula is: RT = a + b log₂(n), where RT is reaction time, n is the number of choices, and a and b are constants. This logarithmic relationship means that going from 2 to 4 choices adds the same decision time as going from 4 to 8.</p>

        <h2>Why This Happens</h2>
        <p>Hick's Law operates because of how our brains process information:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sequential Processing:</strong> We evaluate options one by one, comparing them against criteria</li>
            <li><strong>Working Memory Limits:</strong> More choices require holding more information in mind simultaneously</li>
            <li><strong>Comparison Complexity:</strong> Each new option must be compared against all previous options</li>
            <li><strong>Uncertainty Reduction:</strong> Each choice represents a decision point that requires cognitive effort to resolve</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Restaurant Menus:</strong> A menu with 10 items leads to faster ordering than one with 100 items. The Cheesecake Factory's famously massive menu often results in longer decision times and more regret about choices not made.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>TV Remote Controls:</strong> A remote with 50 buttons takes longer to navigate than one with 10. This is why Apple TV's minimalist remote was revolutionary—fewer choices mean faster use.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Website Navigation:</strong> A navigation menu with 5 clear options performs better than one with 15 options. Users can find what they need faster when choices are limited and clear.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Emergency Response:</strong> In crisis situations, having too many options can be fatal. Fighter pilots and emergency responders train with simplified decision trees because speed matters more than having every option available.
        </div>

        <h2>Applications in Design</h2>
        <p>Hick's Law is fundamental to user experience design:</p>

        <div class="tips">
            <h3>Reduce Choice When Speed Matters:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Checkout flows:</strong> Minimize steps and options to reduce cart abandonment</li>
                <li><strong>Search results:</strong> Show the most relevant results first, not all results</li>
                <li><strong>Forms:</strong> Use smart defaults and progressive disclosure</li>
                <li><strong>Error recovery:</strong> Provide one clear path forward, not many options</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Organize Choices When Variety Is Necessary:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Categorization:</strong> Group related items to reduce perceived complexity</li>
                <li><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> Present choices in stages rather than all at once</li>
                <li><strong>Filtering:</strong> Let users narrow down options before choosing</li>
                <li><strong>Recommendations:</strong> Highlight suggested choices to simplify decisions</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>When Hick's Law Doesn't Apply</h2>
        <p>The law has important limitations:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Familiar Choices:</strong> Experts can choose quickly regardless of options (a pianist doesn't slow down with 88 keys)</li>
            <li><strong>Random Selection:</strong> If choices don't matter, number doesn't affect time</li>
            <li><strong>Highly Differentiated Options:</strong> When choices are clearly distinct, decisions can be fast</li>
            <li><strong>Muscle Memory:</strong> Learned behaviors bypass decision-making entirely</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Important:</strong> Hick's Law applies to decision time, not user preference. Users may prefer more options even if it slows them down. The jam study (Paradox of Choice) showed that more options can reduce both decisions AND satisfaction.
        </div>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>Hick's Law reveals a fundamental trade-off in design: flexibility versus speed. Every option you add has a cost—it makes decisions slower and more cognitively demanding. The art is in providing enough choice for users to get what they need, without so much that they become paralyzed or frustrated.</p>

        <p>When designing interfaces, menus, or processes, ask: "Does this option justify the cognitive cost it adds?" Often, the answer is no—and removing options actually improves the experience.</p>

        <h1>Price Anchoring</h1>

        <div class="highlight">
            "The first price you see becomes the anchor against which all subsequent prices are judged—whether or not that anchor is relevant or rational."
            <br><strong>— Based on research by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>What Price Anchoring Is</h2>
        <p>Price anchoring is a cognitive bias where the first price encountered for a product or service disproportionately influences all subsequent judgments about value. The initial number becomes an "anchor" that pulls our estimates toward it, even when we try to adjust away from it—and even when the anchor is arbitrary or irrelevant.</p>

        <p>The effect is remarkably robust. Anchoring influences professional appraisers, experienced negotiators, and experts in their fields. Knowing about the bias doesn't eliminate it. The anchor's gravitational pull on judgment persists even when people are warned about it.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Insufficient Adjustment:</strong> When we encounter an anchor, we adjust away from it to reach our estimate. But we typically don't adjust enough. A $1,000 anchor for a watch makes $600 feel reasonable, even if the watch's fair value is $200.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Selective Accessibility:</strong> The anchor activates related information that's consistent with it. A high price makes you think of reasons why something might be valuable; a low price activates thoughts about why it might be cheap.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Numeric Priming:</strong> Even irrelevant numbers can anchor judgment. Experiments show that spinning a random number wheel before asking unrelated estimation questions still influences answers.
        </div>

        <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Retail Pricing:</strong> "Was $200, now $99!" The crossed-out price anchors perception of value, making the sale price seem like a bargain even if $99 exceeds fair value.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Real Estate:</strong> Listing prices anchor buyer expectations. An overpriced listing that reduces may still sell for more than if it had been priced correctly from the start, because the anchor persists.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Salary Negotiation:</strong> Whoever names a number first sets the anchor. The entire negotiation then revolves around adjustments from that initial figure.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Menu Design:</strong> Expensive items at the top of a menu anchor expectations, making mid-range items feel reasonable by comparison.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Legal Settlements:</strong> Initial demands or offers anchor negotiations. Extreme opening positions, while often rejected, pull final settlements in their direction.
        </div>

        <h2>Why It's So Powerful</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Uncertainty:</strong> When we don't know true value, any information (including irrelevant anchors) reduces uncertainty</li>
            <li><strong>Cognitive Efficiency:</strong> Adjusting from an anchor is easier than calculating from scratch</li>
            <li><strong>Confirmation Bias:</strong> Once anchored, we seek information consistent with that anchor</li>
            <li><strong>Effort Asymmetry:</strong> Full adjustment requires more cognitive effort than partial adjustment</li>
            <li><strong>Awareness Doesn't Help:</strong> Unlike some biases, knowing about anchoring doesn't prevent it</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Strategic Implications</h2>

        <div class="tips">
            <h3>For Sellers:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Set High Anchors:</strong> Show higher prices first (original price, competitor price, premium version)</li>
                <li><strong>Use Decoys:</strong> Include expensive options to make target options seem reasonable</li>
                <li><strong>Frame Comparisons:</strong> Control what buyers compare against</li>
                <li><strong>Create Reference Points:</strong> Establish "regular price" before showing "sale price"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>For Buyers:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Research First:</strong> Establish your own anchor through independent research before seeing seller prices</li>
                <li><strong>Consider Alternatives:</strong> What else could you buy for this money? Create competing anchors</li>
                <li><strong>Ignore Arbitrary Numbers:</strong> "Was $500" is irrelevant if no one ever paid $500</li>
                <li><strong>Counter-Anchor:</strong> Introduce your own low anchor to pull negotiations down</li>
                <li><strong>Walk Away:</strong> Sometimes leaving resets the anchoring dynamic</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
        <p>Price anchoring raises ethical questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Deceptive Anchors:</strong> Fake "original prices" that no one ever paid are arguably fraudulent</li>
            <li><strong>Manipulation vs. Persuasion:</strong> Where's the line between legitimate marketing and exploitation?</li>
            <li><strong>Vulnerable Populations:</strong> Those with less experience or information are more susceptible</li>
            <li><strong>Systemic Effects:</strong> Widespread anchoring may distort markets and harm price discovery</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>Price anchoring demonstrates that we don't evaluate prices in absolute terms—we judge them relative to reference points. The first number we encounter exerts gravitational pull on all subsequent judgments, even when we know it's arbitrary or manipulated.</p>

        <p>This insight has profound implications for negotiation, marketing, and personal finance. Those who understand anchoring can use it strategically in selling and negotiation. Those who want to resist it must deliberately create their own anchors through independent research before encountering others' numbers. In a world of strategic anchoring, the price you see first isn't just information—it's influence.</p>

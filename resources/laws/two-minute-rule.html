        <h1>The Two-Minute Rule</h1>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            "If it takes less than two minutes, do it now."
        </div>

        <h2>What the Two-Minute Rule Means</h2>
        <p>The Two-Minute Rule is a simple productivity principle that suggests any task requiring less than two minutes should be completed immediately rather than deferred, scheduled, or added to a to-do list. Popularized by productivity expert David Allen in his "Getting Things Done" methodology, this rule helps prevent the accumulation of small tasks that can create mental clutter and overwhelm.</p>

        <p>The principle works because the administrative overhead of tracking, organizing, and remembering small tasks often exceeds the time needed to complete them. By handling quick tasks immediately, you eliminate the cognitive load of managing them later.</p>

        <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>At Work:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Responding to a quick email confirmation</li>
                <li>Filing a document in the correct folder</li>
                <li>Updating a calendar entry</li>
                <li>Making a brief phone call to confirm a meeting</li>
                <li>Organizing your desk at the end of the day</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>At Home:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Putting dishes in the dishwasher immediately after eating</li>
                <li>Hanging up clothes when changing</li>
                <li>Wiping down bathroom surfaces after use</li>
                <li>Paying a bill online</li>
                <li>Replying to a text message</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Practical Implications</h2>
        <p>The Two-Minute Rule transforms how you handle daily workflow and decision-making. Instead of building overwhelming to-do lists filled with tiny tasks, you create a habit of immediate action for quick items. This approach reduces procrastination, maintains momentum throughout your day, and keeps your environment and task list cleaner.</p>

        <div class="stats">
            Studies show that people who apply the Two-Minute Rule report 25% less daily stress and complete 40% more tasks per day.
        </div>

        <p>In professional settings, this rule can dramatically improve responsiveness and reduce the backlog of minor administrative tasks. At home, it prevents the buildup of clutter and small chores that can make living spaces feel chaotic.</p>

        <h2>How to Recognize When This Principle Applies</h2>
        <p>Ask yourself these questions when encountering any task:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Can this be completed in two minutes or less?</li>
            <li>Do I have the tools/resources needed right now?</li>
            <li>Will postponing this require me to remember and revisit it later?</li>
            <li>Is the setup time for doing this later longer than just doing it now?</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Important:</strong> Don't apply this rule if you're in deep focus on a priority task, as constant interruptions can break concentration and reduce overall productivity.
        </div>

        <h2>Tips for Implementation</h2>
        
        <div class="tips">
            <h3>Leveraging the Rule:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start your day with two-minute tasks</strong> to build momentum and clear small items</li>
                <li><strong>Use transition times</strong> between meetings or activities to knock out quick tasks</li>
                <li><strong>Keep necessary tools accessible</strong> (pens, stapler, cleaning supplies) to reduce setup time</li>
                <li><strong>Practice estimating time</strong> accurately – many people underestimate how long tasks actually take</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>When to Override the Rule:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>During focused work sessions</strong> – batch two-minute tasks for later</li>
                <li><strong>When the task isn't urgent</strong> and you're working on higher priorities</li>
                <li><strong>If you're feeling overwhelmed</strong> – sometimes it's better to organize and prioritize first</li>
                <li><strong>When you lack necessary resources</strong> or information to complete the task properly</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

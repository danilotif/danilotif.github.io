        <h1>Fundamental Attribution Error</h1>

        <div class="highlight">
            "We judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their actions."
            <br><strong>— Common observation of attribution asymmetry</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>What the Fundamental Attribution Error Is</h2>
        <p>The Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE), also called correspondence bias, is the tendency to overemphasize personal characteristics and underemphasize situational factors when explaining others' behavior. When someone cuts us off in traffic, we assume they're a jerk—not that they might be rushing to an emergency.</p>

        <p>Crucially, this bias operates asymmetrically. We explain our own behavior by citing circumstances ("I was late because traffic was terrible") while explaining others' identical behavior by citing character ("They're late because they're irresponsible"). This asymmetry creates systematic misunderstanding in human relations.</p>

        <h2>How It Manifests</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>The Self-Other Asymmetry:</strong> When you fail a test, it's because the test was unfair or you were sick. When a classmate fails, it's because they're not smart or didn't try. Same outcome, different explanations.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Workplace Judgments:</strong> A colleague misses a deadline, and we conclude they're unreliable. We miss a deadline, and we know it was the impossible workload, the unclear requirements, the lack of resources.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Social Behavior:</strong> Someone is quiet at a party—they must be unfriendly or boring. We're quiet at a party—we're tired, or it's loud, or we don't know anyone.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Economic Judgments:</strong> Poverty is attributed to laziness or bad choices rather than systemic barriers, lack of opportunity, or bad luck. Success is attributed to hard work and talent rather than privilege, timing, or circumstances.
        </div>

        <h2>Why We Make This Error</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Information Asymmetry:</strong> We know our own circumstances intimately but see only others' actions</li>
            <li><strong>Cognitive Efficiency:</strong> Character-based explanations are simpler than analyzing complex situational factors</li>
            <li><strong>Attention Focus:</strong> When observing others, the person is the focus; the situation is background</li>
            <li><strong>Just World Belief:</strong> We want to believe people get what they deserve, which requires character-based explanations</li>
            <li><strong>Control Illusion:</strong> Character explanations suggest outcomes are controllable through personal virtue</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Consequences</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Relationship Damage:</strong> Partners attribute conflict to each other's character flaws rather than circumstantial stressors. "You're selfish" replaces "you're stressed," creating escalating resentment.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Hiring Mistakes:</strong> Interview behavior is attributed to personality rather than interview stress. Candidates who interview well are assumed to be competent; those who interview poorly are assumed to be incompetent.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Policy Failures:</strong> Social problems attributed to individual failings lead to punitive rather than supportive interventions. If poverty is laziness, the solution is pressure. If it's circumstance, the solution is opportunity.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Management Errors:</strong> Poor performance attributed to employee character leads to replacement rather than environmental fixes. The next employee faces the same circumstances and fails similarly.
        </div>

        <h2>Correcting for the Bias</h2>

        <div class="tips">
            <h3>Mental Exercises:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Situation First:</strong> Before judging character, force yourself to list situational explanations</li>
                <li><strong>Role Reversal:</strong> Ask how you'd explain the same behavior if you did it</li>
                <li><strong>Base Rate Check:</strong> If most people would behave similarly in that situation, character isn't the explanation</li>
                <li><strong>Empathy Practice:</strong> Actively imagine the pressures, constraints, and context facing the other person</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Structural Solutions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>System Focus:</strong> When problems recur across different people, look at the system, not the individuals</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple Observations:</strong> Don't judge character from single instances; patterns require multiple data points across contexts</li>
                <li><strong>Context Documentation:</strong> When evaluating performance, document circumstances, not just outcomes</li>
                <li><strong>Charitable Interpretation:</strong> Default to the most generous situational explanation that fits the facts</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Cultural Variation</h2>
        <p>The Fundamental Attribution Error is stronger in individualistic Western cultures than in collectivist Eastern cultures. Cultures that emphasize individual agency and responsibility show stronger character-based attributions, while cultures emphasizing social context and interdependence show more situational attributions. This suggests the bias is partly cultural, not purely cognitive.</p>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>The Fundamental Attribution Error systematically distorts how we understand others' behavior. We're too quick to conclude "that's just who they are" and too slow to ask "what situation are they in?" This asymmetry—explaining ourselves situationally and others dispositionally—creates misunderstanding, unfair judgments, and failed interventions.</p>

        <p>The correction is deliberate: before attributing behavior to character, pause to consider circumstances. What pressures, constraints, or contexts might explain this behavior? How would you explain identical behavior if you did it? This mental discipline doesn't eliminate judgment but makes it more accurate—and more fair.</p>

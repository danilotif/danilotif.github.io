        <h1>Negativity Bias</h1>

        <div class="highlight">
            "Bad is stronger than good across a broad range of psychological phenomena"
            <br><strong>— Roy Baumeister, 2001</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>What Negativity Bias Means</h2>
        <p>Negativity bias is the tendency for negative events, emotions, and information to have a greater impact on our psychological state than positive ones of equal intensity. Bad experiences, bad feedback, and bad impressions are more powerful, more memorable, and more influential than equivalent good ones.</p>

        <p>This isn't a flaw—it's adaptive. Throughout evolution, paying attention to threats (negative) was more important for survival than savoring rewards (positive). Missing a predator was fatal; missing a berry was not.</p>

        <h2>How Negativity Bias Manifests</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stronger reactions:</strong> A single criticism stings more than a compliment pleases</li>
            <li><strong>Better memory:</strong> We remember insults longer than praise</li>
            <li><strong>Greater attention:</strong> Negative stimuli capture attention more readily</li>
            <li><strong>Heavier weighting:</strong> Bad information influences decisions more than good</li>
            <li><strong>Slower fading:</strong> Negative emotions dissipate more slowly than positive ones</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Research Findings</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>The 5:1 Ratio:</strong> Relationship researcher John Gottman found that stable marriages have about 5 positive interactions for every negative one. One negative interaction requires five positive ones to balance. Below this ratio, relationships deteriorate.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Reviews Impact:</strong> One negative review can neutralize the effect of several positive reviews. People weight negative information more heavily when forming opinions about products, people, or experiences.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>News Consumption:</strong> Negative news stories generate more clicks, shares, and engagement than positive ones. Media outlets exploit negativity bias because it drives attention.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Performance Feedback:</strong> A single piece of critical feedback is remembered and ruminated on far longer than equivalent positive feedback. Managers need to balance criticism with multiple positive observations.
        </div>

        <h2>Implications for Design and Business</h2>

        <div class="tips">
            <h3>Customer Experience:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Prevent negatives first:</strong> Eliminating pain points matters more than adding delights</li>
                <li><strong>Error handling:</strong> How you handle problems defines the experience more than smooth operations</li>
                <li><strong>Service recovery:</strong> A well-handled complaint can create more loyalty than no problem at all (service recovery paradox)</li>
                <li><strong>Review management:</strong> Responding to negative reviews is more important than celebrating positive ones</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Communication:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lead with positives:</strong> Sandwich bad news between good to reduce impact</li>
                <li><strong>Ratio awareness:</strong> Multiple positive interactions before one negative</li>
                <li><strong>Specificity matters:</strong> Vague criticism is harder to process than specific, actionable feedback</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Overcoming Negativity Bias</h2>
        <p>Strategies for more balanced thinking:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Savoring:</strong> Deliberately extend and appreciate positive experiences</li>
            <li><strong>Gratitude practices:</strong> Actively noticing positives counteracts the natural negativity tilt</li>
            <li><strong>Reframing:</strong> Consider alternative interpretations of negative events</li>
            <li><strong>Proportionality check:</strong> Ask "Is this as bad as my reaction suggests?"</li>
            <li><strong>Time perspective:</strong> "Will this matter in a year?" often reveals disproportionate reactions</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Important:</strong> Negativity bias isn't always wrong. Sometimes negative information genuinely is more important—danger signals, warning signs, serious problems. The bias becomes problematic when minor negatives receive the same weight as major ones, or when we ruminate unproductively.
        </div>

        <h2>The Asymmetry of Good and Bad</h2>
        <p>Key asymmetries to understand:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Bad events have stronger impact than good events</li>
            <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Negative emotions last longer than positive ones</li>
            <li><strong>Attention:</strong> Threats capture attention faster than rewards</li>
            <li><strong>Learning:</strong> We learn more from failures than successes (though we hate admitting it)</li>
            <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Trust is built slowly (many positive interactions) but destroyed quickly (one betrayal)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>Understanding negativity bias is essential for anyone designing experiences, giving feedback, managing relationships, or trying to maintain personal well-being. The world isn't balanced between good and bad in our psychology—bad weighs more.</p>

        <p>This means: prevent bad experiences rather than just creating good ones. Provide multiple positive interactions to balance any negative. And recognize that your own reactions to negative events may be disproportionate to their actual significance. Bad is stronger than good—but awareness of this asymmetry is the first step to adjusting for it.</p>

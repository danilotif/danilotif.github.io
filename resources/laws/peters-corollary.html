        <h1>Peter's Corollary</h1>

        <div class="highlight">
            "In time, every post tends to be occupied by an employee who is incompetent to carry out its duties... Work is accomplished by those employees who have not yet reached their level of incompetence."
            <br><strong>— Laurence J. Peter, The Peter Principle (1969)</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>What Peter's Corollary Means</h2>
        <p>Peter's Corollary is the logical extension of the Peter Principle. If people rise through hierarchies until they reach their level of incompetence, then over time, all positions will be filled by people who can't do them well. The corollary concludes that actual productive work must therefore be accomplished by those who haven't yet been promoted to incompetence.</p>

        <p>This creates a peculiar organizational dynamic: the people doing the real work are often those in lower positions, while those at higher levels—having reached their incompetence threshold—contribute less actual value while consuming more resources and authority.</p>

        <h2>How This Plays Out</h2>

        <h3>The Competence Drain</h3>
        <p>Organizations systematically remove their best performers from productive work by promoting them into roles requiring different skills. An excellent engineer becomes a mediocre manager. A brilliant analyst becomes an ineffective director. The promotion is a "reward" that often punishes both the individual and the organization.</p>

        <h3>The Productivity Inversion</h3>
        <p>As a result, the people with the least authority often produce the most value, while those with the most authority have long since stopped being productive in any direct sense. Junior employees do the work; senior employees approve it (often poorly) and take credit for it.</p>

        <div class="stats">
            Observable patterns in organizations:<br>
            70% of work output comes from 30% of employees<br>
            Individual productivity often peaks mid-career, then declines with promotion<br>
            "Superstar" performers are frequently promoted away from their area of excellence<br>
            Organizations often have more managers than the work actually requires
        </div>

        <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>The Promoted Programmer:</strong> Sarah was an extraordinary software developer. She was promoted to engineering manager. Now she spends her days in meetings, doing mediocre people management, while junior developers write code—sometimes poorly, because the person who should be mentoring them is stuck in status meetings.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>The Sales Director:</strong> Tom was the company's best salesperson. They promoted him to sales director. He's ineffective at strategy and coaching but keeps getting promoted because of his historical numbers. The actual sales are made by newer reps who haven't been promoted away from selling yet.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>The Academic Department:</strong> Research is largely done by PhD students and postdocs. Professors—promoted for their research excellence—now spend their time on administration, grant-writing, and committee work that they're not particularly good at.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>The Hospital Administration:</strong> The best doctors often become department heads, spending their time on budgets and policies rather than treating patients. Healthcare is delivered by those who haven't yet been promoted out of patient care.
        </div>

        <h2>Implications for Organizations</h2>

        <h3>The Hidden Workforce</h3>
        <p>Recognize that much of your organization's actual productivity comes from people who aren't in senior positions. These are the individuals who haven't yet been promoted past their competence—and they should be protected from premature promotion.</p>

        <h3>Dual Career Tracks</h3>
        <p>Create career paths that allow advancement without requiring management. Let excellent engineers become senior engineers with higher pay and status, without forcing them into management roles where they'll be mediocre.</p>

        <h3>Promotion Criteria</h3>
        <p>Promote based on skills needed for the new role, not just excellence in the current one. Being the best salesperson doesn't qualify someone to manage salespeople—those are different jobs requiring different abilities.</p>

        <div class="tips">
            <strong>Organizational strategies:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Create individual contributor tracks:</strong> Allow advancement without management</li>
                <li><strong>Test before promoting:</strong> Trial periods in new roles before permanent promotion</li>
                <li><strong>Allow downward moves:</strong> Remove stigma from returning to roles where one excels</li>
                <li><strong>Separate pay from hierarchy:</strong> Top contributors can earn more than their managers</li>
                <li><strong>Value current excellence:</strong> Reward people for being great where they are</li>
                <li><strong>Assess management potential separately:</strong> Don't assume technical skills transfer</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Implications for Individuals</h2>

        <h3>Know Your Strengths</h3>
        <p>Understanding Peter's Corollary helps you think carefully about promotions. Will the new role use your strengths? Are you being promoted into something you'll be good at, or away from something you're great at? Sometimes the best career move is to stay where you excel.</p>

        <h3>Avoid the Prestige Trap</h3>
        <p>Society conditions us to see promotion as success. But moving from a role where you're excellent and fulfilled to one where you're mediocre and stressed is not actually success—it's the Peter Principle in action. Prestige is a poor substitute for competence and satisfaction.</p>

        <h3>Find Your Level</h3>
        <p>The goal isn't to climb as high as possible—it's to find the level where you can contribute most effectively while maintaining satisfaction. This might be lower in the hierarchy than you expected, but that's not failure; it's wisdom.</p>

        <h2>The Deeper Problem</h2>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Why this keeps happening:</strong> Organizations typically reward only one dimension—hierarchical advancement. This creates pressure to promote people until they fail, rather than keeping them where they succeed. The system is designed to produce the very incompetence it laments.
        </div>

        <h2>Alternative Models</h2>

        <h3>The Lattice Organization</h3>
        <p>Some companies have moved away from strict hierarchies to "lattice" structures where people can move in multiple directions—not just up. This creates more opportunity while reducing the pressure that drives Peter's Corollary.</p>

        <h3>Rotational Leadership</h3>
        <p>Some organizations rotate leadership roles rather than making them permanent promotions. This allows people to develop management skills without permanently leaving their area of competence.</p>

        <h3>Merit-Based Everything</h3>
        <p>When pay, respect, and opportunity aren't tied solely to hierarchy, people have less incentive to accept promotions into incompetence. They can stay where they're effective without sacrificing status or compensation.</p>

        <p>Peter's Corollary is darkly humorous but also practically important. Understanding it helps organizations retain their productive people in productive roles, and helps individuals make better decisions about which opportunities to accept. Sometimes the best promotion is the one you don't take.</p>

        <h1>Commitment and Consistency</h1>

        <div class="highlight">
            "Once we have made a choice or taken a stand, we will encounter personal and interpersonal pressures to behave consistently with that commitment"
            <br><strong>— Robert Cialdini, 1984</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>What Commitment and Consistency Means</h2>
        <p>The principle of commitment and consistency states that once people commit to something—especially publicly or in writing—they feel compelled to behave consistently with that commitment. We have a deep psychological need to appear (and believe ourselves to be) consistent with our past actions and statements.</p>

        <p>This drive for consistency is so strong that we'll often stick with choices even when circumstances change and the original choice no longer makes sense. We adjust our beliefs to match our behaviors rather than admit inconsistency.</p>

        <h2>Why Consistency Matters to Us</h2>
        <p>Our drive for consistency serves several functions:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Social Trust:</strong> Consistent people are predictable and trustworthy. Inconsistency signals unreliability.</li>
            <li><strong>Cognitive Efficiency:</strong> Once a decision is made, we don't have to keep re-evaluating. Consistency saves mental effort.</li>
            <li><strong>Identity Maintenance:</strong> Our sense of self depends on coherent narratives. Inconsistency threatens identity.</li>
            <li><strong>Reducing Dissonance:</strong> Contradicting ourselves creates uncomfortable cognitive dissonance that we're motivated to avoid.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Foot-in-the-Door Technique</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Classic Experiment:</strong> Researchers asked homeowners to put a small "Be a Safe Driver" sticker in their window. Two weeks later, they asked for a large, ugly sign in their yard. Those who agreed to the sticker were 4x more likely to accept the sign—the small commitment changed their self-image to "someone who supports safe driving."
        </div>

        <p>This "foot-in-the-door" technique works because small commitments change how we see ourselves. Once we've taken a position, we're motivated to stay consistent with it.</p>

        <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Sales Tactics:</strong> Car dealers get you to agree on the car before discussing price, financing, or add-ons. Once you've mentally committed, you're reluctant to back out over details.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Onboarding Flows:</strong> Apps that get you to complete small setup steps increase long-term retention. Each step is a micro-commitment that builds investment.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Public Pledges:</strong> Weight-loss programs that ask for public commitments see higher success rates. The public nature strengthens the consistency pressure.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Written Commitments:</strong> Goals written down are more likely to be achieved. The act of writing creates a stronger commitment than mental decisions.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Lowball Technique:</strong> Make an attractive offer to secure commitment, then change the terms. People often stick with the deal even after the terms worsen because they've already committed.
        </div>

        <h2>Using Commitment Ethically</h2>

        <div class="tips">
            <h3>Positive Applications:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Habit formation:</strong> Small daily commitments build toward lasting change</li>
                <li><strong>Goal achievement:</strong> Public commitments increase accountability</li>
                <li><strong>User onboarding:</strong> Progressive commitments build genuine engagement</li>
                <li><strong>Team alignment:</strong> Getting explicit agreement increases follow-through</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Making Commitments Stick:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Active over passive:</strong> Actions are stronger than thoughts</li>
                <li><strong>Public over private:</strong> Witnessed commitments carry more weight</li>
                <li><strong>Written over verbal:</strong> Writing creates a stronger record and commitment</li>
                <li><strong>Effortful over easy:</strong> Commitments that cost something are valued more</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Defending Against Manipulation</h2>
        <p>When consistency is being used against you:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Recognize the tactic:</strong> Ask yourself if you're doing something because it's right or because you said you would</li>
            <li><strong>Separate past from present:</strong> Your circumstances or information may have changed since the original commitment</li>
            <li><strong>It's okay to change your mind:</strong> Consistency with new information is more rational than consistency with past mistakes</li>
            <li><strong>Watch for escalation:</strong> Small requests followed by larger ones is a classic pattern</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid premature commitment:</strong> Don't agree to things before you have full information</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Important:</strong> "Foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds." — Emerson. Being consistent with past mistakes is worse than admitting error. The goal is to be consistent with your values, not your every past action.
        </div>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>Commitment and consistency is one of the most powerful principles of influence because it operates automatically. Once we've taken a position, our self-image, social reputation, and cognitive ease all push us to stay consistent.</p>

        <p>This can be harnessed for good—building habits, achieving goals, creating genuine engagement. But it can also be exploited—trapping people in escalating commitments or maintaining loyalty to bad decisions. Understanding this principle helps you use it wisely and defend against its misuse.</p>

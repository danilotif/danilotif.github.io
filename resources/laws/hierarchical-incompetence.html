        <h1>Hierarchical Incompetence</h1>

        <div class="highlight">
            "Authority and expertise rarely reside in the same person. The person who knows most about a problem is seldom the one with the power to solve it."
            <br><strong>— Organizational observation</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>What Hierarchical Incompetence Means</h2>
        <p>Hierarchical incompetence describes the structural mismatch between organizational authority and subject matter expertise. In most organizations, decision-making power flows from position in the hierarchy, while knowledge about specific problems resides with those closest to the work. These rarely align.</p>

        <p>This isn't about individual incompetence—leaders may be highly capable in their domains. The problem is structural: hierarchies concentrate decision rights at levels removed from operational reality, while expertise concentrates where work actually happens. The result is decisions made by those least equipped to make them.</p>

        <h2>Why It Happens</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Promotion Patterns:</strong> People are promoted for succeeding at one level, then make decisions about work they no longer do. A brilliant engineer becomes a manager making engineering decisions without current hands-on knowledge.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Information Loss:</strong> As information travels up hierarchies, it gets summarized, filtered, and distorted. Leaders make decisions based on abstractions of reality rather than reality itself.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Expertise Specialization:</strong> Modern work requires deep specialization. No generalist leader can match the expertise of specialists in every domain they oversee.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Authority Concentration:</strong> Organizations centralize decision rights for control and accountability, even when this separates authority from knowledge.
        </div>

        <h2>How It Manifests</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Technology Decisions:</strong> Executives choose software platforms based on vendor relationships and presentations while engineers who understand technical requirements have limited input. The result: systems that look good in PowerPoint but fail in practice.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Policy Implementation:</strong> Headquarters creates policies without understanding local conditions. Field workers know the policies won't work but lack authority to modify them. Compliance becomes theater.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Budget holders allocate resources based on proposals and politics rather than operational understanding. Teams that know what's needed can't get it; resources flow to those skilled at requesting them.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Strategic Planning:</strong> Leaders set direction based on market analysis and financial models while frontline employees who understand customer reality aren't consulted. Strategy disconnects from execution capability.
        </div>

        <h2>The Consequences</h2>
        <p>When authority and expertise diverge, organizations suffer in predictable ways:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Poor Decisions:</strong> Choices made without adequate understanding of their implications</li>
            <li><strong>Slow Response:</strong> Information must travel up for decisions, then down for implementation</li>
            <li><strong>Workarounds:</strong> Those with expertise develop informal systems to route around formal authority</li>
            <li><strong>Disengagement:</strong> Experts become cynical when their knowledge is ignored</li>
            <li><strong>Knowledge Hoarding:</strong> People learn that sharing knowledge upward doesn't influence decisions</li>
            <li><strong>Cover-Your-Back Culture:</strong> Following orders protects careers even when experts know better</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Addressing the Mismatch</h2>

        <div class="tips">
            <h3>Organizational Approaches:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Decision Subsidiarity:</strong> Push decisions to the lowest level with adequate information</li>
                <li><strong>Expertise Councils:</strong> Give subject matter experts formal advisory roles in decisions</li>
                <li><strong>Reverse Mentoring:</strong> Junior experts educate senior leaders on technical realities</li>
                <li><strong>Gemba Walks:</strong> Leaders regularly observe work where it happens</li>
                <li><strong>Dual Career Tracks:</strong> Technical advancement paths that don't require management roles</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Individual Strategies:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Translate Expertise:</strong> Frame technical knowledge in terms leaders understand and value</li>
                <li><strong>Build Relationships:</strong> Informal influence can supplement formal authority</li>
                <li><strong>Document Predictions:</strong> Record expert assessments before decisions; track outcomes</li>
                <li><strong>Propose Pilots:</strong> Small experiments can demonstrate expertise value</li>
                <li><strong>Accept Limits:</strong> Some hierarchical constraints are unchangeable; focus energy where influence is possible</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Related Concepts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Peter Principle:</strong> Promotion to incompetence explains how expertise gaps develop</li>
            <li><strong>Conway's Law:</strong> System design reflects organizational structure, including its competence gaps</li>
            <li><strong>Dunning-Kruger Effect:</strong> Those with authority may overestimate their expertise</li>
            <li><strong>Information Asymmetry:</strong> The economic concept underlying expertise-authority gaps</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>Hierarchical incompetence isn't a failure of individuals but a structural feature of organizations. Hierarchies exist for coordination, accountability, and control—not for optimizing every decision. Some authority-expertise mismatch is inevitable.</p>

        <p>The goal isn't eliminating hierarchy but designing organizations that route decisions toward expertise when possible, while maintaining necessary coordination. This requires leaders humble enough to recognize their knowledge limits and experts skilled enough to influence without authority. Neither is easy, but both are essential for organizations that want to make good decisions.</p>

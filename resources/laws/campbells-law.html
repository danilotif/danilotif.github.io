        <h1>Campbell's Law</h1>

        <div class="highlight">
            "The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor."
            <br><strong>— Donald T. Campbell, 1979</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>What Campbell's Law Means</h2>
        <p>Campbell's Law, closely related to Goodhart's Law, describes what happens when measurements meant to assess performance become targets used for rewards or punishments. The measurement ceases to accurately reflect what it was designed to measure because people optimize for the metric itself rather than the underlying goal.</p>

        <p>The law highlights a fundamental problem with quantitative management: any measure that becomes important enough to drive decisions will be gamed, manipulated, or optimized in ways that divorce it from its original purpose.</p>

        <h2>How It Happens</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Teaching to the Test:</strong> When school funding depends on standardized test scores, schools narrow curricula to tested subjects and teach test-taking strategies rather than genuine understanding. Scores may rise while actual education quality falls.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Crime Statistics:</strong> When police are evaluated on crime rates, some departments reclassify crimes to less serious categories or discourage reporting. The statistics improve while actual safety doesn't.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Wait Time Targets:</strong> When hospitals are penalized for long emergency room wait times, some keep patients in ambulances outside to avoid starting the clock. The metric improves while patient experience worsens.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Publication Counts:</strong> When academics are evaluated by publication numbers, they slice research into minimum publishable units, inflate authorship lists, and pursue safe, publishable research over important but risky investigations.
        </div>

        <h2>Mechanisms of Corruption</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Selection Distortion:</strong> Focusing on what's measured while neglecting unmeasured aspects of the goal</li>
            <li><strong>Data Manipulation:</strong> Changing how data is collected or reported to improve metrics</li>
            <li><strong>Threshold Gaming:</strong> Concentrating effort on cases near pass/fail thresholds while neglecting others</li>
            <li><strong>Cream Skimming:</strong> Selecting easy cases that improve metrics while avoiding hard ones</li>
            <li><strong>Teaching to the Metric:</strong> Optimizing specifically for measurement procedures rather than underlying performance</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Wells Fargo Scandal:</strong> When employees were evaluated on new account openings, they created millions of fake accounts. The metric was being hit; customer service was being destroyed.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Soviet Production Quotas:</strong> Factories measured by weight produced heavy, unusable goods. Factories measured by quantity produced tiny, useless items. The metrics were met; economic value wasn't created.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Healthcare Quality Metrics:</strong> Surgeons evaluated on mortality rates avoid high-risk patients who need surgery most. The metric improves; patient outcomes across the system worsen.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Customer Satisfaction Surveys:</strong> Employees beg customers for high ratings, offer incentives, or only survey satisfied customers. Satisfaction scores rise while actual service quality is unknown.
        </div>

        <h2>Why It's So Hard to Avoid</h2>

        <div class="tips">
            <h3>Structural Pressures:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accountability Demands:</strong> Organizations need measurable outcomes to demonstrate performance</li>
                <li><strong>Scale Requirements:</strong> Large organizations can't evaluate everything qualitatively</li>
                <li><strong>Comparison Needs:</strong> Quantitative metrics enable comparisons across units and time</li>
                <li><strong>Incentive Design:</strong> Rewards and punishments require measurable criteria</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mitigation Strategies:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Multiple Metrics:</strong> Use several measures to prevent gaming any single one</li>
                <li><strong>Qualitative Supplements:</strong> Combine quantitative metrics with qualitative assessment</li>
                <li><strong>Metric Rotation:</strong> Change metrics periodically to prevent optimization</li>
                <li><strong>Process Audits:</strong> Monitor how metrics are achieved, not just whether they're hit</li>
                <li><strong>Lower Stakes:</strong> Use metrics for learning rather than high-stakes decisions</li>
                <li><strong>Unexpected Measurement:</strong> Measure things people don't know will be measured</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Campbell's Law vs. Goodhart's Law</h2>
        <p>These laws are closely related but emphasize different aspects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Goodhart's Law:</strong> Focuses on the statistical phenomenon—when a measure becomes a target, it loses its validity as a measure</li>
            <li><strong>Campbell's Law:</strong> Emphasizes the corruption of social processes—the measurement system itself becomes distorted through gaming and manipulation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Both describe the same fundamental problem: measurement for high-stakes decisions corrupts both the measure and the measured.</p>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>Campbell's Law warns that measurement systems are not neutral observers—they reshape the reality they measure. When metrics drive decisions, people optimize for metrics rather than goals. The more important the metric, the more pressure to game it.</p>

        <p>This doesn't mean we should abandon measurement, but we should use it wisely. Keep stakes moderate. Use multiple measures. Supplement with qualitative judgment. Audit processes, not just outcomes. And maintain humility about what any metric truly captures. The map is not the territory, and the metric is not the goal.</p>

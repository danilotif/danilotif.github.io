        <h1>Decoy Effect</h1>

        <div class="highlight">
            "Adding an inferior option can make a different option more attractive"
            <br><strong>— Joel Huber, John Payne, and Christopher Puto, 1982</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>What the Decoy Effect Means</h2>
        <p>The decoy effect (also called asymmetric dominance) occurs when adding a third, inferior option changes preference between two existing options. The decoy is designed to be clearly worse than one option (making that option look better) but not clearly worse than the other (so the comparison doesn't help that option).</p>

        <p>The decoy itself is rarely chosen—that's not its purpose. Its purpose is to make the "target" option look better by comparison, increasing its selection rate.</p>

        <h2>How the Decoy Effect Works</h2>
        <p>Consider a subscription pricing example:</p>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Without Decoy:</strong><br>
            • Digital only: $59/year<br>
            • Print + Digital: $125/year<br><br>
            Most people choose the cheaper digital-only option.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>With Decoy:</strong><br>
            • Digital only: $59/year<br>
            • Print only: $125/year (THE DECOY)<br>
            • Print + Digital: $125/year<br><br>
            Now most people choose Print + Digital—it "dominates" the print-only option, making it seem like an obvious deal.
        </div>

        <p>The print-only option is rarely chosen, but it makes the combo look like free digital access. This is exactly what The Economist famously used in their pricing.</p>

        <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Movie Theater Popcorn:</strong><br>
            Small: $3, Medium: $6.50, Large: $7<br>
            The medium is the decoy—it makes the large look like a bargain (only 50¢ more for much more popcorn).
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>SaaS Pricing Tiers:</strong> Many software companies add a "Professional" tier that's slightly cheaper than "Enterprise" but missing key features. It makes Enterprise look more valuable.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Real Estate Showings:</strong> Good agents show a slightly inferior house at a similar price to the one they want to sell. The comparison makes the target property look better.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Restaurant Menus:</strong> An expensive wine that few people order makes the second-most-expensive wine look reasonable. It's not there to sell—it's there to shift choices.
        </div>

        <h2>Why This Works Psychologically</h2>
        <p>The decoy effect exploits several cognitive tendencies:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Relative Comparison:</strong> We evaluate options by comparing them, not in absolute terms</li>
            <li><strong>Easy Choices Feel Good:</strong> When one option clearly dominates another, choosing feels easier and more confident</li>
            <li><strong>Justification:</strong> We can more easily justify a choice that dominates another option</li>
            <li><strong>Cognitive Load Reduction:</strong> The decoy simplifies decision-making by creating a clear winner in one comparison</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Creating Effective Decoys</h2>

        <div class="tips">
            <h3>Decoy Design Principles:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Asymmetric dominance:</strong> The decoy must be clearly worse than the target but not clearly worse than the competitor</li>
                <li><strong>Similar price point:</strong> The decoy should be priced near the target to make the comparison salient</li>
                <li><strong>Worse on key attributes:</strong> The decoy should be inferior on attributes where the target excels</li>
                <li><strong>Not too bad:</strong> If the decoy is obviously terrible, it may not be considered at all</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Defending Against Decoy Effects</h2>
        <p>When making decisions:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Identify the decoy:</strong> Ask "which option is clearly dominated by another?" That's probably the decoy.</li>
            <li><strong>Remove it mentally:</strong> Make your decision as if the decoy doesn't exist</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on absolute value:</strong> Does the target option meet your needs at a fair price, regardless of comparisons?</li>
            <li><strong>Define criteria first:</strong> Know what you need before seeing options, so comparisons don't sway you</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Ethical Note:</strong> The decoy effect can be used ethically (helping customers see genuine value) or manipulatively (steering people toward higher-margin products they don't need). The line depends on whether the "target" option actually serves the customer better.
        </div>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>The decoy effect demonstrates that our preferences aren't fixed—they're constructed in the moment based on available options. Adding or removing options can shift choices even when the options themselves don't change.</p>

        <p>This is a powerful principle for pricing, marketing, and product design. But it also reveals a vulnerability in human decision-making that can be exploited. Understanding the decoy effect helps you both use it responsibly and defend against it.</p>

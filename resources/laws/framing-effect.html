        <h1>Framing Effect</h1>

        <div class="highlight">
            "People react differently to the same information depending on how it's presented"
            <br><strong>— Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, 1981</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>What the Framing Effect Means</h2>
        <p>The framing effect demonstrates that the way information is presented (the "frame") significantly influences decisions and judgments, even when the underlying facts are identical. The same choice can seem attractive or unattractive, risky or safe, depending entirely on how it's framed.</p>

        <p>This effect reveals that human decision-making is not purely rational—we don't objectively evaluate facts. We respond to how facts are packaged and presented.</p>

        <h2>The Classic Asian Disease Problem</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Positive Frame (Lives Saved):</strong><br>
            Program A: 200 people will be saved.<br>
            Program B: 1/3 probability all 600 saved, 2/3 probability nobody saved.<br>
            <em>Result: 72% chose Program A (certain option)</em>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Negative Frame (Lives Lost):</strong><br>
            Program C: 400 people will die.<br>
            Program D: 1/3 probability nobody dies, 2/3 probability 600 die.<br>
            <em>Result: 78% chose Program D (risky option)</em>
        </div>

        <p>Programs A and C are identical. Programs B and D are identical. But framing in terms of lives saved vs. lives lost completely reversed preferences. People are risk-averse for gains and risk-seeking for losses.</p>

        <h2>Types of Framing</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Gain vs. Loss Framing:</strong><br>
            • "You'll save $50" vs. "You'll avoid losing $50"<br>
            • "95% fat-free" vs. "5% fat"<br>
            • "90% survival rate" vs. "10% mortality rate"
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Attribute Framing:</strong><br>
            • "75% lean beef" sounds healthier than "25% fat beef"<br>
            • Same product, different perception based on which attribute is highlighted
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Goal Framing:</strong><br>
            • "Get the benefits of X" (gain frame) vs. "Don't miss out on X" (loss frame)<br>
            • Emphasizing what you'll gain vs. what you'll lose by not acting
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Risky Choice Framing:</strong><br>
            • Same expected outcome framed as certain vs. probabilistic<br>
            • "Definitely save $30" vs. "50% chance to save $60"
        </div>

        <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Medical Decisions:</strong> Patients are more likely to accept surgery when told "90% survival rate" than "10% mortality rate"—even though these are mathematically identical.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Marketing:</strong> "80% natural ingredients" is more appealing than "20% artificial ingredients." Same product, different frame.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Pricing:</strong> "$2.99" feels significantly cheaper than "$3.00" due to left-digit anchoring. A 33% discount sounds better than "buy 3, get 1 free" even though they're equivalent.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Political Communication:</strong> "Estate tax" vs. "death tax" frames the same policy very differently. "Pro-choice" vs. "anti-life" and "pro-life" vs. "anti-choice" are deliberate frames.
        </div>

        <h2>Using Framing Ethically</h2>

        <div class="tips">
            <h3>When to Use Gain Frames:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Promoting products or behaviors where you want risk-averse choices</li>
                <li>When you want people to stick with safe, certain options</li>
                <li>Building positive brand associations</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>When to Use Loss Frames:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Motivating action against a current behavior (health warnings, security alerts)</li>
                <li>When inaction has consequences you want to emphasize</li>
                <li>Creating urgency for change</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Match frame to truth:</strong> If something is genuinely risky, a loss frame may be appropriate</li>
                <li><strong>Don't manipulate:</strong> Choose frames that help people make better decisions, not worse ones</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Consider presenting multiple frames for important decisions</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Defending Against Framing</h2>
        <p>To make better decisions:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reframe the choice:</strong> If presented with gains, think about losses (and vice versa)</li>
            <li><strong>Strip away the frame:</strong> What are the actual numbers and facts?</li>
            <li><strong>Consider both perspectives:</strong> How would this look framed differently?</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on base rates:</strong> What's the absolute probability, not just relative framing?</li>
            <li><strong>Beware emotional language:</strong> Loaded words are often framing devices</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Important:</strong> You cannot avoid framing—every presentation of information involves some frame. The goal isn't frame-free communication (impossible) but awareness of how frames shape perception. Choose frames consciously and ethically.
        </div>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>The framing effect demonstrates that human judgment is not based on objective facts alone—it's based on how those facts are presented. The same information can lead to opposite decisions depending on framing. This isn't a minor quirk; it's a fundamental feature of human cognition.</p>

        <p>Understanding framing is essential for anyone communicating information—marketers, doctors, policymakers, designers. And it's essential for anyone making decisions—which is everyone. The frame is never neutral. Being aware of framing is the first step to making better choices and communicating more effectively.</p>

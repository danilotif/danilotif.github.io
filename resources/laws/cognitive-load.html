        <h1>Cognitive Load</h1>

        <div class="highlight">
            "The total amount of mental effort being used in working memory at any given time"
            <br><strong>— John Sweller, 1988</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>What Cognitive Load Means</h2>
        <p>Cognitive load refers to the amount of mental processing power required to complete a task. Our working memory has limited capacity—typically 4-7 items at once. When cognitive load exceeds capacity, performance suffers: we make errors, slow down, miss details, and become frustrated.</p>

        <p>Every element that requires attention—text to read, choices to make, information to remember—adds to cognitive load. Good design minimizes unnecessary load so users can focus on what matters.</p>

        <h2>Three Types of Cognitive Load</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Intrinsic Load:</strong> The inherent difficulty of the task itself. Learning calculus has higher intrinsic load than learning addition. This can be managed but not eliminated.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Extraneous Load:</strong> Unnecessary difficulty added by poor design. Confusing interfaces, irrelevant information, and unclear instructions add extraneous load. This should be eliminated.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Germane Load:</strong> Mental effort devoted to learning and understanding. This is productive load that should be encouraged—it's how people actually learn and grow.
        </div>

        <p>The goal is to minimize extraneous load, manage intrinsic load, and maximize germane load.</p>

        <h2>Signs of Cognitive Overload</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Errors and mistakes:</strong> Users make more mistakes when overloaded</li>
            <li><strong>Slow performance:</strong> Processing takes longer</li>
            <li><strong>Task abandonment:</strong> Users give up when overwhelmed</li>
            <li><strong>Tunnel vision:</strong> Focus narrows, missing important information</li>
            <li><strong>Frustration and fatigue:</strong> Mental exhaustion sets in quickly</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Complex Checkout Forms:</strong> Forms asking for unnecessary information increase cognitive load and cart abandonment. Each field is a mental task.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Information-Dense Dashboards:</strong> Showing 50 metrics at once overwhelms users. Progressive disclosure—showing details on demand—reduces load.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Instructions While Doing:</strong> Having to read instructions while performing a task splits attention. Better to show one step at a time.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Meeting Overload:</strong> Back-to-back meetings leave no time for processing. Mental fatigue accumulates, and productivity plummets.
        </div>

        <h2>Reducing Cognitive Load</h2>

        <div class="tips">
            <h3>Simplify Information:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Progressive disclosure:</strong> Show only what's needed now; reveal more on demand</li>
                <li><strong>Chunking:</strong> Group related items (phone numbers: 555-123-4567)</li>
                <li><strong>Visual hierarchy:</strong> Make important things stand out</li>
                <li><strong>Remove clutter:</strong> Every element competes for attention</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reduce Memory Requirements:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Recognition over recall:</strong> Show options rather than requiring users to remember them</li>
                <li><strong>Visible information:</strong> Don't make users remember information from previous screens</li>
                <li><strong>Smart defaults:</strong> Pre-fill when possible</li>
                <li><strong>Persistent context:</strong> Keep relevant information visible</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Support Decision-Making:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Limit choices:</strong> Follow Hick's Law—fewer options mean faster decisions</li>
                <li><strong>Recommendations:</strong> Highlight suggested options</li>
                <li><strong>Comparison tools:</strong> Help users evaluate options side-by-side</li>
                <li><strong>Clear actions:</strong> Make next steps obvious</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Cognitive Load and Learning</h2>
        <p>In educational contexts:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Worked examples:</strong> Showing solutions reduces load while teaching problem-solving</li>
            <li><strong>Scaffolding:</strong> Temporary support that's removed as competence grows</li>
            <li><strong>Spaced practice:</strong> Distributing learning over time reduces per-session load</li>
            <li><strong>Dual coding:</strong> Combining words and images can reduce load (if well-designed) or increase it (if redundant)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Important:</strong> Some cognitive load is necessary for learning and engagement. A task with zero challenge is boring. The goal is to optimize load—not eliminate it—keeping users in a state of productive challenge without overwhelming them.
        </div>

        <h2>Measuring Cognitive Load</h2>
        <p>Signs to watch in user research:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time on task:</strong> Longer times suggest higher load</li>
            <li><strong>Error rates:</strong> More errors indicate overload</li>
            <li><strong>Task completion:</strong> Abandonment signals excessive difficulty</li>
            <li><strong>User feedback:</strong> "This is confusing" is a cognitive load signal</li>
            <li><strong>Physiological measures:</strong> Pupil dilation, heart rate variability correlate with mental effort</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>Cognitive load is the hidden cost of every design decision. Every feature added, every choice offered, every piece of information displayed taxes users' limited mental resources. The best designs feel effortless because they've minimized extraneous load, leaving capacity for what actually matters.</p>

        <p>Ask yourself: "What mental work am I asking users to do? Is it necessary? How can I reduce the unnecessary parts?" Respecting cognitive limits isn't dumbing down—it's good design.</p>

        <h1>Gresham's Law</h1>

        <div class="highlight">
            "Bad money drives out good."
            <br><strong>— Attributed to Sir Thomas Gresham, 16th century</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>What Gresham's Law Means</h2>
        <p>Gresham's Law, traditionally stated as "bad money drives out good," describes what happens when two forms of money with the same face value but different intrinsic values circulate together. People will spend the debased (bad) money and hoard the valuable (good) money, eventually driving good money out of circulation.</p>

        <p>The law emerges from rational individual behavior: if a silver coin and a copper coin are both legally worth one dollar, you'll spend the copper coin and keep the silver. Everyone does this, so copper coins circulate while silver disappears into hoards or gets melted for its metal value.</p>

        <h2>Historical Examples</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Roman Currency Debasement:</strong> As Roman emperors reduced silver content in coins to fund spending, people hoarded older, purer coins. The debased currency dominated circulation while quality coins disappeared.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>U.S. Silver Coins:</strong> When silver prices rose in the 1960s, silver coins became worth more as metal than as currency. They rapidly disappeared from circulation as people hoarded them, forcing the switch to copper-nickel coins.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Zimbabwe Hyperinflation:</strong> As the Zimbabwean dollar collapsed, U.S. dollars and South African rand (good money) were hoarded while people rushed to spend rapidly-depreciating local currency (bad money).
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Bimetallic Systems:</strong> When countries fixed gold-silver exchange rates different from market rates, the undervalued metal disappeared from circulation while the overvalued metal dominated.
        </div>

        <h2>Why It Happens</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Arbitrage Opportunity:</strong> When face value exceeds intrinsic value, spending makes sense; when intrinsic value exceeds face value, hoarding makes sense</li>
            <li><strong>Rational Self-Interest:</strong> Each individual benefits from keeping good money and spending bad money</li>
            <li><strong>Collective Outcome:</strong> Individual rational choices produce collective irrational result—good money disappears</li>
            <li><strong>Information Asymmetry:</strong> Sellers can't always detect debased currency, so they receive it unwittingly</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Modern Extensions</h2>
        <p>Gresham's Law has been extended beyond currency to describe similar dynamics in other domains:</p>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Used Car Markets (Lemons):</strong> Sellers know if their car is good or bad; buyers don't. Sellers of good cars won't accept prices that reflect average quality, so they exit the market. Bad cars dominate, driving out good ones.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Labor Markets:</strong> If employers can't distinguish good from bad workers and pay the same wage, good workers may leave for better opportunities while poor performers stay.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Content Platforms:</strong> When low-effort viral content gets the same visibility as quality work, creators of quality may exit, leaving platforms dominated by clickbait.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Professional Standards:</strong> If unqualified practitioners can compete with qualified ones (perhaps through lower prices), quality providers may be driven from the market.
        </div>

        <h2>Conditions for Gresham's Law</h2>

        <div class="tips">
            <h3>The law operates when:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fixed Exchange Rate:</strong> Good and bad money trade at the same official value</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Tender Laws:</strong> Both forms must be accepted at face value</li>
                <li><strong>Identifiable Difference:</strong> People can distinguish good from bad money</li>
                <li><strong>Intrinsic Value Difference:</strong> One form has higher commodity or alternative value</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The law is reversed when:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Market Rates Prevail:</strong> If exchange rates are flexible, good money commands a premium</li>
                <li><strong>Refusal Rights:</strong> If people can refuse bad money, it loses its advantage</li>
                <li><strong>Uncertainty:</strong> When bad money may not be accepted, good money may be preferred</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Policy Implications</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Currency Design:</strong> Governments should avoid creating conditions where rational behavior drives out quality currency</li>
            <li><strong>Quality Standards:</strong> Markets need mechanisms to prevent low-quality options from dominating</li>
            <li><strong>Information Provision:</strong> Reducing information asymmetries can prevent Gresham dynamics</li>
            <li><strong>Premium Pricing:</strong> Allowing quality to command higher prices prevents its disappearance</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>Gresham's Law illuminates a fundamental dynamic: when quality differences exist but prices are fixed, people's rational individual choices drive quality from the market. This applies far beyond currency—to products, labor, content, and services.</p>

        <p>The solution is allowing prices to reflect quality differences, or providing information that lets buyers distinguish good from bad. When these mechanisms fail, markets systematically select against quality, and bad drives out good—a collective loss produced by individually rational choices.</p>
